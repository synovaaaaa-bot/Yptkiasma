## 🎨 Replace Logos Later (Optional)

Your site is using **placeholder logos** now. They work fine, but you should replace them with real logos later.

**When you're ready:**
1. Read [LOGO-REPLACEMENT-GUIDE.md](./LOGO-REPLACEMENT-GUIDE.md)
2. Follow the simple steps
3. Redeploy

**For now:** Just deploy! Logos can wait.
